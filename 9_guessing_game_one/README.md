## [Exercise 9](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/02/09-guessing-game-one.html)

### [Solution](https://www.practicepython.org/solution/2014/04/10/09-guessing-game-one-solutions.html)

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very [first exercise](https://github.com/AlexCRosa/practicing_python/tree/cca196e2da9de80dc5ebbc03a2a0e7e8b95531d4/1_character_input))

#### Extras:

1. Keep the game going until the user types “exit”. 
2. Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
