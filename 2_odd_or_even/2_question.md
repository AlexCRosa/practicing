### [Solution](https://www.practicepython.org/solution/2014/02/15/02-odd-or-even-solutions.html)

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

#### Extras:

1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
