### [Solution](https://www.practicepython.org/solution/2014/05/28/15-reverse-word-order-solutions.html)

Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

  `My name is Michele`

Then I would see the string:

  `Michele is name My`

shown back to me.
