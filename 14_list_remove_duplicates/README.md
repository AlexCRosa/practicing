## [Exercise 14](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/05/15/14-list-remove-duplicates.html)

### [Solution](https://www.practicepython.org/solution/2014/05/21/14-list-remove-duplicates-solutions.html)

Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

#### Extras:

1. Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
2. Go back and do [Exercise 5](https://github.com/AlexCRosa/practicing_python/blob/5a1e6333b0b71f90c6a4f5226c5be74fc0419463/5_list_overlap/5_list_overlap.py) using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.
